\chapter{A Comment on the Center of Gravity} \label{cp:cg}

% Briefly introduce the topic/purpose of this chapter, what information can be found in this chapter, and the key findings.

We also wanted to highlight our model changes that fixed our center of gravity position, positioning it almost at the quarter-chord of our wing chord. A redistribution of payload weights was performed. The most important one, was changing for a single 4500 mAh battery to two 3000 mAh batteries, both positioned in the nose, attempting to move the CG foward. In addition, modifications were made to the fuselage design, the main wing was moved back relative to the fuselage, and the tail was made lighter by reducing the volume of denser materials. In the following figures REF and REF, we can see an overview of our model an the current position of the CG. The total weight of the aircraft is estimated to be 10.8 lb. If needed during manufacturing, we plan to attach extra weight at the nose tip to finish positioning the CG at the wing quarter-chord.
